## A color theme that reinterprets the Firefly Pro Theme

This theme is built on top of ankit's awesome [Fire Fly Pro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ankitcode.firefly) theme and makes use of a Palette mainly composed of three secondary colors, is optimized for a variety of programming languages, tries to increase the readability and fix some contrast issues of the original theme and put's its focus on highlighting function calls.
